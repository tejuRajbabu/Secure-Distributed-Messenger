## Architecture Overview

### Threading Model
- **Main Thread:** Runs the console input loop (`Console.ReadLine()`) and parses commands (`ConsoleUI.ParseCommand()`) and dispatches all command actions. Also manages startup and graceful shutdown.
- **Receive Thread:** A backround thread (`ReceiveThread`) that blocks on `_queue.DequeueIncoming(cancellationToken))`. For incoming messages, we wake it up via `_ui.DisplayMessage()`to print it. We exit cleanly when the cancellation token is triggered on shutdown. 
- **Send Thread:** A backround thread (`SendThread`) that blocks on `_queue.DequeueOutgoing(cancellationToken)`. When outgoing messages that are in queue, it wakes up and calls `_server?.BroadcastMessage(message)` if listening or `_client?.Send(message)` if connected. We exit cleanly on cancellation.

### Thread-Safe Message Queue
The `MessageQueue` class inside `Core/MessageQueue.cs`. implements a producer/consumer pattern using two separate `BlockingCollection<Message>` instances. `_incoming` for messages received from the network and `_outgoing` for messages to be sent. `BlockingCollection<Message>` is thread-safe, so we do not use manual locking required.

* `EnqueueIncoming()` / `EnqueueOutgoing()` 
    * Thread-safe adds to queue by network event handlers
* `DequeueIncoming(token)` / `DequeueOutgoing(token)` 
    * Block `Take()` calls that sleep the consumer thread until message is available
* `CancellationTokenSource.Cancel()`
    * Unblcok `Take()` by passing the cancellation token, and `CompleteAdding()` finalizes adding items.
